## 🎮 Skill Combo Macro System

### Overview

The skill combo system provides **36 configurable keybind slots** with intelligent cooldown tracking and randomized attack patterns.

### Available Keybinds

- **Number Row**: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `0`, `-`, `=`
- **Alt + Keys**: `alt+1` through `alt+=`
- **Ctrl + Keys**: `ctrl+1` through `ctrl+=`

**Total: 36 keybind slots** ✅

### Configuration (100% GUI - No File Editing!)

**All configuration is done through the GUI:**

1. **Main Window Controls:**
   - ✅ **Enable/Disable** attack mode randomization
   - ✅ **Attack Mode Weights** (standard vs skills vs combos)
   - ✅ **Health Requirement** (only use skills when health bar detected)

2. **⚙️ Edit Individual Skills Button:**
   - Configure skill cooldowns for each keybind
   - Set single skill pool for random selection
   - Adjust GCD (Global Cooldown) for single skills
   - Add/remove skills with visual table editor

3. **🎯 Edit Combo Sets Button:**
   - Create/edit/delete combo sets
   - Set combo names, cooldowns, and delays
   - Define skill sequences (one per line)
   - Enable/disable specific combos
   - Visual list management

**No more editing `skill_combo_config.py` manually!**

See `GUI_SKILL_EDITOR_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### Attack Mode

**Randomized Attack Patterns:**
- **50%** - Standard Tab-target attack
- **30%** - Single random skill press
- **20%** - Full combo set execution

**Smart Behavior:**
- ✅ Only uses skills when `mob_combat_health` is detected
- ✅ **Single-target** + skill/combo (not mouse click based)
- ✅ **Keyboard-targeting** for standard attacks (Tab + R/T)
- ✅ Tracks individual skill cooldowns
- ✅ Tracks combo set cooldowns
- ✅ Only executes when ALL skills ready

### How It Works

```
Combat Detected → Choose Attack Mode (random)
                       ↓
    ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
    │                  │                  │
Standard (50%)    Single Skill (30%)   Combo (20%)
   │                  │                  │
Tab-target       Single-click +      Single-click +
    mob           random skill         skill combo
```

**Example Execution:**
```
1. Bot detects mob with health bar
2. Chooses "Single Skill" mode (30% chance)
3. Single-clicks mob to target
4. Presses skill '2' (hardware-level)
5. Skill '2' goes on 12s cooldown
6. Next attack: might be a Tab-target (50%) or combo (20%)
```

### Testing

Unit tests were removed when the project was converted to a purely
user-mode input implementation; use the GUI or run the application to
validate behavior interactively.

## 🎯 Combat System

### Detection & Targeting

- **Nearest Mob Selection**: Always attacks closest mob to player
- **Click Position**: Lower part of detection box (70-90% down)
- **Mouse Jitter**: ±15 pixels for human-like variation
- **Health Bar Detection**: Continues attacking until health disappears

### Attack Modes

1. **Standard Attack (Tab + R/T)**:
   - Targets the next monster with `Tab`, then performs a single R (light) or T (heavy) press to initiate combat
   - Most common (50% default)
   - No mouse double-click or drag is used — targeting is keyboard-based

2. **Single Skill Attack**:
   - Single-clicks to target mob
   - Presses one random skill
   - Skill goes on individual cooldown

3. **Combo Set Attack**:
   - Single-clicks to target mob
   - Executes full skill rotation
   - All skills + combo go on cooldown

### Movement & Navigation

- **Minimap Red Dots**: Detects and navigates toward enemies
- **70° Turns**: Holds A/D keys for full turns (not just tap)
- **Movement Macros**: 7 randomized patterns (zigzag, circles, etc.)
- **Smooth Mouse**: Bezier curve dragging (0.15-0.40s)

## Input timing and attack modes

The project provides configurable attack modes and reasonable default input timings. The application requires the Interception kernel driver / DLL for reliable hardware-level input simulation and offers configurable combo and skill execution behavior.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Input Methods

**Primary: Interception (kernel driver)**
This project requires the Interception kernel driver and its `interception.dll` as the
sole supported input backend. The application no longer includes fallbacks to
user-mode input libraries or AutoHotkey; Interception must be installed and the
DLL must match your Python bitness.

### AI Object Detection

- **YOLOv8 Model**: Real-time detection (overlay updated frequently, model-driven rate)
- **Classes Detected**:
  - `mob_target` - Enemy mobs
  - `mob_combat_health` - Active health bars
  - `minimap_red_dot` - Minimap indicators
- **Custom Training**: Model trained on AION screenshots

## 📋 Usage Examples (All GUI-Based!)

### Example 1: Pure Keyboard-Target Bot (No Skills)

**In Main Window:**
- ✓ Uncheck "Enable randomized attack mode"

**Result:** Bot will **only** target with Tab and use R/T (no skills used)

---

### Example 2: Always Use Combo Sets

**In Main Window:**
- ✓ Check "Enable randomized attack mode"
   - Set Standard Attack Weight (Tab-target): **0.00** (0%)
- Set Single Skill Weight: **0.00** (0%)
- Set Combo Set Weight: **1.00** (100%)

**Result:** Bot will **only** execute combo sets (when ready)

---

### Example 3: Balanced Combat (Default)

**In Main Window:**
- ✓ Check "Enable randomized attack mode"
   - Set Standard Attack Weight (Tab-target): **0.50** (50%)
- Set Single Skill Weight: **0.30** (30%)
- Set Combo Set Weight: **0.20** (20%)

**Result:** Randomized attacks with balanced distribution

---

### Example 4: High Skill Usage (Aggressive)

**In Main Window:**
- ✓ Check "Enable randomized attack mode"
   - Set Standard Attack Weight (Tab-target): **0.20** (20%)
- Set Single Skill Weight: **0.50** (50%)
- Set Combo Set Weight: **0.30** (30%)

**Result:** Bot uses skills 80% of the time (more aggressive)

---

### Example 5: Create Custom Combo

**Step-by-step:**
1. Click **"🎯 Edit Combo Sets"** button
2. Click **"➕ New Combo"**
3. Enter name: `My Ultimate Rotation`
4. Check **"Enabled"**
5. Set cooldown: `120` seconds
6. Set delay: `0.5` seconds
7. Enter skills (one per line):
   ```
   1
   2
   alt+1
   ctrl+1
   3
   ```
8. Click **"💾 Save Combo"**
9. Click **"Close"**

**Result:** New combo set ready to use!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Triggering

**Symptoms**: Bot only uses standard Tab-target attacks, never uses skills

**Solutions**:
1. Check `ATTACK_MODE_RANDOMIZATION_ENABLED = True`
2. Verify attack weights sum to ~1.0
3. Ensure `REQUIRE_MOB_HEALTH_FOR_SKILLS = True` and health bars are detected
4. Check individual skill cooldowns (may still be on cooldown)
5. Run `python test_skill_combos.py` to validate config

---

### Skills Wrong Keys

**Symptoms**: Wrong skills being pressed

**Solutions**:
1. Check `SKILL_COOLDOWNS` dictionary keys match your game bindings
2. Verify `SINGLE_SKILL_POOL` contains correct keys
3. Check `COMBO_SETS` skill lists
4. Test with: `python -c "from skill_combo_manager import SkillComboManager; m = SkillComboManager(); print(m.skill_cooldowns)"`

---

---

### Combo Sets Not Executing

**Symptoms**: Single skills work, but combos don't

**Solutions**:
1. Check all skills in combo are off cooldown
2. Verify `combo_set` weight > 0.0
3. Check combo `enabled: True` in `COMBO_SETS`
4. Ensure `REQUIRE_MOB_HEALTH_FOR_SKILLS = True` and health detected

---

### "Emergency Stop" Not Responding

**Symptoms**: DELETE key doesn't stop bot

**Solutions**:
1. Click **EMERGENCY STOP** button in GUI (always works)
2. Close the program window
3. Task Manager → End Task on `python.exe`
